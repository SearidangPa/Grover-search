# Grover-search

In this project, I implemented the quantum grover search algorithm using pyquil. Without noise, the programs has a 100% accuracy. I also include a version with a noise simulator. With the noise simulator, the program has excellent accuracy with small qubits but as the size of the program increases, the accuracy drops dramatically.
